    <h1>Great Wall of China</h1>
    <p>
      The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built
      across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and
      Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the
      Eurasian Steppe. Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century
      BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220ñ206
      BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later
      on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of
      border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming
      dynasty (1368ñ1644). Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall
      have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods
      transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and
      the control of immigration and emigration.[6] Furthermore, the defensive
      characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of
      watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities
      through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the
      Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor. The frontier walls
      built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they
      stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from the
      present-day SinoñRussian border in the north to Tao River (Taohe) in the
      south; along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian
      steppe; spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total.[7][3] Today, the
      defensive system of the Great Wall is generally recognized as one of the
      most impressive architectural feats in history.[8]
