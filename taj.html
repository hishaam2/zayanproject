    <h1>Taj Mahal</h1>
    <p>
      The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/; lit. 'Crown of the
      Palace')[4][5][6] is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of
      the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in
      1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the
      tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah
      Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)
      complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal
      gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. Construction of the
      mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other
      phases of the project for another 10 years. The first ceremony held at the
      mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th
      anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The mausoleum was opened at that
      time to thousands of mourners.[7][8] The Taj Mahal complex is believed to
      have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the
      time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35
      billion (US$498 million).[9] The construction project employed some 20,000
      artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad
      Lahori, the emperor's court architect. Various types of symbolism have
      been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity. The Taj
      Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being
      "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired
      masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as the best
      example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The
      Taj Mahal attracts 7-8 million visitors a year,[10] and in 2007 it was
      declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007)
      initiative.
